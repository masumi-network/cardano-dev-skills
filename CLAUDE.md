# Cardano Dev Skills

Community-curated knowledge base for building on Cardano. This repo is a Claude Code plugin and Codex-compatible skill set.

## Repo Structure

- `registry/sources.yaml` — canonical list of Cardano projects and their documentation sources
- `skills/` — <!-- COUNT:skills -->15<!-- /COUNT:skills --> developer skills (flat layout — each skill is `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
- `scripts/` — validation, fetch, sync, and scaffolding tooling
- `hooks/` — session-level hooks (freshness check; prompt-time context injection planned)
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — architectural decisions
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to add sources, skills, refresh content, and the source-vetting policy

## Documentation Sources

The `docs/sources/` directory contains documentation extracted from <!-- COUNT:sources -->55<!-- /COUNT:sources --> Cardano projects.
When a skill or user needs to look up SDK APIs, CIP specs, or tool docs, search here first:

```
docs/sources/aiken/                         # Aiken language docs
docs/sources/mesh-sdk/                      # Mesh SDK API docs
docs/sources/evolution-sdk/                 # Evolution SDK docs
docs/sources/cips/                          # All CIP proposals
docs/sources/ogmios/                        # Ogmios WebSocket bridge
docs/sources/cardano-use-case-templates/    # 21 Foundation use-case templates
...
```

Use `Read` and `Grep` tools to search these directories for accurate, up-to-date information.

## Conventions

- Skills follow the Agent Skills standard: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- SKILL.md files must be under 500 lines; deep content goes in `references/` (one level deep only)
- Skill names are kebab-case, max 64 characters; directory name matches `name:` field
- `registry/sources.yaml` is the single source of truth for documentation sources
- Skills are self-contained — work with `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` only, no external service dependencies
- When referencing documentation, guide the user to search or read rather than pasting specs

## Skill Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >-
  What this skill does. Include trigger phrases.
allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob
---
```

Required sections: When to use, When NOT to use, Key principles, Workflow.

## Quality Standards

- Behavioral guidance over reference dumps
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Include trade-offs and decision criteria
- Prescriptiveness scales with risk (strict for security, flexible for exploration)
- No hardcoded paths — use relative references

## Documentation Governance

Docs must reflect current state. When you change something **observable from outside this repo**, update related docs in the same PR. "Observable" means counts, capabilities, structure, interfaces, file lists, or workflows. Pure internal tweaks (refactor a script, fix a typo in a skill body) don't trigger doc updates.

### What to update for each change type

| Change | Update these docs |
|---|---|
| New skill (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) | README.md skills table; DESIGN.md if it changes the skill graph. Pages site skills catalog auto-regenerates on build. |
| New source in `registry/sources.yaml` | Run `scripts/update-doc-counts.sh` (counts auto-update); CONTRIBUTING.md only if introducing a new category or format. Pages site sources catalog auto-regenerates on build. |
| New schema field (category, format, etc.) | `registry/sources.yaml` header comment; CONTRIBUTING.md valid-values lists; DESIGN.md if it's architectural |
| New script in `scripts/` | README.md "Contributing" / "Architecture" section if user-facing |
| New hook in `hooks/` | README.md "How to set the Cardano context" section; CLAUDE.md repo structure; `website/src/content/docs/how-it-works.md` |
| Scope / vetting / governance policy change | CLAUDE.md governance section; CONTRIBUTING.md; `website/src/content/docs/contributing/` pages |
| Vision / "why" change | README.md; `website/src/content/docs/about/why.md` |
| Install flow change | README.md install section; `website/src/content/docs/getting-started.md` |
| Roadmap change | Memory `project_skill_roadmap.md`; `website/src/content/docs/about/roadmap.md` |
| Removed/renamed file or path | All docs that reference it — grep first |

### Auto-derived counts

`scripts/update-doc-counts.sh` rewrites count sentinels in CLAUDE.md and README.md from disk state. Sentinels look like `<!-- COUNT:skills -->15<!-- /COUNT:skills -->` and are invisible in rendered output. CI runs the script in `--check` mode on every PR — drift fails the build. Run the script locally before pushing.

### Source-vetting bar

When adding to `registry/sources.yaml`:
- Last commit < 6 months old
- ≥1 release tag OR active issue/PR activity in the last 3 months
- No archived/deprecated/sunset banner
- For forks: pick the maintained canonical (e.g. Evolution SDK is the live fork of dead Lucid Evolution)
- **No branded dApps.** The repo teaches BUILDING on Cardano, not how specific deployed products work. Generic primitives (SDKs, frameworks, validator libraries, design patterns, infrastructure) are in scope. Product docs for specific dApps (SundaeSwap, Minswap, Liqwid, Indigo, JPG Store, etc.) are not.

Full policy lives in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### When in doubt

Grep the repo for the thing you're changing — file name, count, label, terminology. If it appears in any doc, update it.
