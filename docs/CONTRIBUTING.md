# Contributing to Cardano Dev Skills

This guide covers source vetting, adding sources, adding skills, refresh, documentation governance, and quality standards.

## Scope: what belongs in this repo

This repo teaches **building on Cardano**. It is a generic knowledge base for AI coding agents and developers.

**In scope:**
- SDKs, frameworks, validator libraries, design patterns, language tooling
- Infrastructure (nodes, indexers, chain providers)
- Protocol and standard specs (CIPs, ledger specs)
- Reference implementations of *patterns* (e.g. multisig oracle contracts as a pattern, not as a product manual)
- Generic dApp categories: DEX, lending, NFT marketplace, oracle consumer, governance tool

**Out of scope:**
- Product docs for specific deployed dApps (SundaeSwap, Minswap, Liqwid, Indigo, JPG Store, etc.). These belong on each project's own site; users who need them can ask their agent to search the web.
- Closed-source content
- Marketing material

Borderline rule: if the upstream repo's primary purpose is *"use OUR product"*, it's out. If it's *"here's how X pattern works, here's the reference code"*, it's in.

## Source-vetting policy

Before adding any new entry to `registry/sources.yaml`, verify the upstream repo is actively maintained:

1. **Last commit < 6 months old**
2. **≥1 release tag OR active issue/PR activity in the last 3 months**
3. **No archived / deprecated / sunset banner** in README or repo settings
4. **For forks**, pick the maintained canonical (concrete example: Evolution SDK is the live fork of dead Lucid Evolution — always prefer the live one)

If signals are ambiguous (e.g. low commit frequency but a stable mature library; deprecation notice with unclear successor), flag it in the PR rather than guess.

The same bar applies to the candidate entries at the bottom of `registry/sources.yaml` — don't promote a candidate without re-vetting against this bar.

## Adding a new documentation source

### 1. Verify against the vetting policy above

### 2. Edit `registry/sources.yaml`

```yaml
- name: Project Name
  repo: https://github.com/org/repo.git
  docs_path: docs                    # path within the repo containing docs
  format: markdown                   # see "Valid values" below
  category: infrastructure           # see "Valid values" below
  priority: medium                   # high, medium, low
  description: Short description of the project
  # Optional:
  # website: https://project.dev
  # branch: main
  # glob_patterns:
  #   - "**/*.md"
  # format_overrides:
  #   "**/*.yaml": openapi
```

**Valid `format` values:** `markdown`, `mdx`, `rst`, `openapi`, `aiken`, `python`, `toml`

**Valid `category` values:** `infrastructure`, `smart-contracts`, `sdk`, `standards`, `governance`, `scaling`, `testing`, `oracles`

If you need a new category or format, propose it in the PR — both are checked by `scripts/validate.py` against an explicit allow-list.

### 3. Validate

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

### 4. Fetch and verify locally

```bash
./scripts/fetch-docs.sh --source "Project Name"
```

Check that files were actually pulled (`docs/sources/<slug>/`) and that the count looks right.

### 5. Open a PR

CI runs validation automatically. The weekly refresh workflow picks up the new source on its next Monday run.

## Adding a new skill

Skills live flat under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. No category subdirectories.

### 1. Scaffold

```bash
./scripts/new-skill.sh my-new-skill
```

This creates:

```
skills/my-new-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # template
└── references/       # deeper content (one level only)
```

### 2. Write the SKILL.md

```yaml
---
name: my-new-skill
description: >-
  What this skill does. Include 3-5 trigger phrases users would say.
allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob
---

# my-new-skill

## When to use
- Specific scenario 1
- Specific scenario 2

## When NOT to use
- Wrong scenario (redirect to correct skill)

## Key principles
- Domain-specific principle 1
- Domain-specific principle 2

## Workflow

### Step 1: Name
Instructions...

### Step 2: Name
Instructions...

## References
- See [reference-name](references/file.md) for details
```

### 3. Quality checklist

- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] Name is kebab-case, max 64 chars
- [ ] `name:` matches directory name
- [ ] Description includes trigger phrases
- [ ] Has "When to use", "When NOT to use", "Key principles", "Workflow" sections
- [ ] No MCP dependency (no `search_docs` references)
- [ ] Deep content in `references/`, one level only — no nested subdirectories
- [ ] No mention of specific deployed dApps; teach categories generically
- [ ] No mention of grants, treasuries, or governance proposals — the skill must read as a neutral community contribution

### 4. Validate and submit

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py
./scripts/update-doc-counts.sh    # refresh counts in README/CLAUDE
```

Open a PR. CI runs validation + count-drift check.

## Documentation governance

Docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`) must reflect current state. When you change something **observable from outside the repo**, update related docs in the same PR.

### What to update for each change type

| Change | Update these docs |
|---|---|
| New skill | README.md skills table; DESIGN.md if it changes the skill graph |
| New source | Run `scripts/update-doc-counts.sh`; CONTRIBUTING.md only if introducing a new category or format |
| New schema field | `registry/sources.yaml` header comment; CONTRIBUTING.md valid-values lists; DESIGN.md if architectural |
| New script in `scripts/` | README.md if user-facing |
| New hook | README.md "How to set the Cardano context" section; CLAUDE.md repo structure |
| Removed/renamed file | All docs that reference it — grep first |

Pure internal tweaks (refactor a script, fix a typo in a skill body) don't trigger doc updates.

### Auto-derived counts

`scripts/update-doc-counts.sh` rewrites sentinels in CLAUDE.md and README.md from disk state. Sentinels look like `<!-- COUNT:skills -->14<!-- /COUNT:skills -->`. Run before pushing — CI runs `--check` and fails PRs on drift.

## Refreshing content

The weekly workflow (`.github/workflows/refresh-docs.yml`) runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC, fetches all sources, and opens a PR labeled `documentation, automated`. Review the diff and merge.

To trigger manually:

```bash
gh workflow run refresh-docs.yml
```

To refresh locally:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-docs.sh                          # all sources
./scripts/fetch-docs.sh --source "Source Name"   # one source
```

### When to refresh out of band

- Major SDK release changes APIs (e.g. Mesh v2, Evolution SDK breaking changes)
- New CIPs ratified that affect developer workflows
- New vulnerability patterns discovered
- A referenced tool is deprecated or replaced — drop the source AND update relevant skills

## How the MCP server consumes this repo

If you also run the companion `cardano-unified-mcp-server`:

```
sources.yaml  →  sync-sources.sh  →  sources.generated.ts  →  npm run ingest
```

```bash
./scripts/sync-sources.sh ../cardano-unified-mcp-server/src/config/sources.generated.ts
cd ../cardano-unified-mcp-server
npm run ingest                       # all sources
npm run ingest -- "Source Name"      # one source
```

Sync flow is one-directional: `cardano-dev-skills` is the canonical source; the MCP server is a consumer.

## Future automation (tracked, not yet built)

See [DESIGN.md Decision 9](DESIGN.md) for the full roadmap. Highlights:

- `UserPromptSubmit` auto-consultation hook + local usage telemetry
- PR-time source-build check (validates new entries actually clone + match files)
- AI-powered governance review on PRs (advisory comments, not blocking)
- GitHub Pages site with auto-generated catalogs
