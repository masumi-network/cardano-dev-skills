    logs container testnet='cardano_node_master'    # view logs of a container
    ps testnet='cardano_node_master'                # list containers in a testnet

    up testnet='cardano_node_master'                # start a testnet
```

## Running locally

Run the testnet locally before submitting to Antithesis to verify containers start and the chain converges:

```bash
# Start
just up

# Verify all containers are running
just ps

# Watch chain progress
just logs tracer-sidecar

# Stop and clean up volumes
just down
```

The `justfile` wraps `docker compose` commands. All images must be available locally (built) or published to `ghcr.io`.

## Available testnets

- [cardano_node_master](cardano-node-master.md): Mixed-version testnet with producers, relays, tracer observability, Asteria Plutus workload pressure, and tx-generator ADA-transfer pressure
