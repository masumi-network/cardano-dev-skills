# Asteria Game

Single workload container that plays the [asteria][asteria] game inside
the cardano-node-antithesis cluster. It drives realistic transaction
traffic - script spends, minting policies, reference scripts, validity
bounds, inline datums - so Antithesis can explore node behavior under
real ledger pressure instead of only empty-block production.

This component is part of the phase-1 gatherer feature ([#56][issue-56]).

## Adding asteria-game to a testnet

Drop the asteria-game container into any testnet's
`docker-compose.yaml` to give Antithesis a real workload generator on
top of an idle Cardano cluster. The container bundles a long-lived
utxo-indexer plus three short-lived binaries fired by composer
scripts (bootstrap, player, invariant) — see
[the why-it's-here section in the master testnet doc][master-why]
for the rationale.

### Pre-requisites

The host testnet must already have:

- A relay that block producers connect to, e.g. `relay1`, with a
  named volume mounted at `/state` so the asteria-game container
  can read its node socket. The master testnet uses
  `relay1-state:/state`.
- A `utxo-keys` named volume populated by the configurator with
  the genesis wallet skeys (the bootstrap binary needs them to
  sign the deploy tx).
- A network magic of `42`. Other magics are not currently wired —
  `NETWORK_MAGIC` is hard-coded in the player's compose env.

### Compose block

Add this service block under `services:` at the bottom of your
`docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
  asteria-game:
    image: ghcr.io/cardano-foundation/cardano-node-antithesis/asteria-game:<tag>
    container_name: asteria-game
    hostname: asteria-game.example
    environment:
      INDEXER_SOCK: /tmp/idx.sock
      CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH: /state/node.socket
      NETWORK_MAGIC: "42"
    volumes:
      - relay1-state:/state:ro            # read-only N2C socket
      - utxo-keys:/utxo-keys:ro           # genesis skeys for bootstrap
      - asteria-game-db:/idx-db           # RocksDB persistence
      - asteria-deploy:/asteria-deploy    # per-deploy seed TxIn
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp                              # holds /tmp/idx.sock
    depends_on:
      relay1:
        condition: service_started
```

Then declare the two new named volumes under the top-level
`volumes:` block:

```yaml
volumes:
  # … existing volumes …
  asteria-game-db:
  asteria-deploy:
```

`<tag>` is a 7-char short SHA from a commit on this repo. The
`publish-images` workflow rebuilds the image and pushes
`asteria-game:<short-sha>` whenever a commit touches
`components/asteria-game/`. Pick the tag from any green
`publish-images` run on `main`, or use the digest pinned by master
in [`testnets/cardano_node_master/docker-compose.yaml`][master-compose].

The composer scripts that drive the binaries are baked into the
image at build time at `/opt/antithesis/test/v1/asteria-game/` - nothing extra
to mount. The Antithesis composer mounts that path into its execution
sandbox automatically when the test runs.

### Validation gate before merging into a scheduled testnet

Per the project's "no broken container on main testnet" rule, a
new testnet that adds asteria-game must dispatch a 1h Antithesis
run via `workflow_dispatch` on the feature branch and confirm
`findings_new ≤ baseline` before merging. The same gate applied
when promoting asteria-game into [`cardano_node_master`][master-pr-128].

### What does the cluster need to look like

The asteria-game player drives `spawnShip` Plutus transactions
that consume + replace the asteria UTxO. The cluster needs:

- At least one block producer that accepts valid Plutus v3
  transactions (the asteria validators are Aiken-compiled to
  PlutusV3).
- A relay reachable via `relay1.example:3001` (N2N) and
  `relay1-state:/state/node.socket` (N2C). Aliasing it under a
  different name requires editing
  `components/asteria-game/composer/asteria-game/parallel_driver_asteria_player.sh`.
- Genesis funds in `utxo-keys/genesis.1.skey` sufficient for the
  one-time bootstrap deploy plus a few thousand `spawnShip`
  transactions over a 3h run.

The master testnet meets all three by construction. New testnets
that change the topology, network magic, or genesis layout will
need to mirror those choices.

## What it does

The container entrypoint is a long-lived `utxo-indexer` connected to
`relay1` via N2C. The image also ships three short-lived binaries that
the Antithesis composer fires as commands:

- **`asteria-bootstrap`** - serial, idempotent deploy. Picks or reuses
  a deploy seed UTxO, parameter-applies the validators to that seed,
  mints the one-shot `asteriaAdmin` NFT, and locks the initial
  `AsteriaDatum` at the asteria spend address. Re-running is safe:
  once the asteria UTxO exists, bootstrap observes it and skips the
  mint path.
- **`asteria-game`** - parallel workload pass. Reads the asteria UTxO
  through the indexer, plans a move for one of three logical players,
  and today lets player 1 build, sign, and submit a `spawnShip` Plutus
  transaction. The binary exits after one pass; composer provides the
  repetition and concurrency.
- **`asteria-invariant`** - one-shot oracle. Depending on
  `ASTERIA_INVARIANT`, checks either the `asteriaAdmin` singleton or
  end-of-run state consistency between the asteria `ship_counter` and
  the `SHIP*` tokens at the spacetime address.

Composer scripts under `/opt/antithesis/test/v1/asteria-game/`:

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `serial_driver_asteria_bootstrap.sh` | Exclusive bootstrap/deploy command. |
| `parallel_driver_asteria_player.sh` | Concurrent workload command; one observe/spawn pass. |
| `parallel_driver_heartbeat.sh` | Indexer readiness probe during the run. |
| `anytime_asteria_admin_singleton.sh` | Periodic singleton invariant. |
| `eventually_alive.sh` | Post-fault indexer liveness probe. |
| `finally_alive.sh` | End-of-run indexer liveness probe. |
| `finally_asteria_consistency.sh` | End-of-run game-state consistency snapshot. |
| `helper_sdk.sh` | Shared shell SDK emitter and signal-safe wrapper. |

## Assertions

Asteria contributes both workload and oracles:

- `asteria_bootstrap_asteria_created` / `asteria_bootstrap_already_deployed`
  prove deployment either happened or was observed.
- `asteria_player_ship_spawned_1` proves real Plutus spawn
  transactions landed.
- `asteria_admin_singleton` is an `Always` property: exactly one
  `asteriaAdmin` NFT exists at the asteria spend address.
- `asteria_state_consistent` is a `Sometimes` property comparing
  `ship_counter` to `SHIP*` token count.
- `asteria_game eventually_alive holds` and `asteria_game finally_alive holds` prove the
  long-lived indexer is responsive and close to the chain tip.

## Build the image

### Nix

```bash
cd components/asteria-game
nix build .#docker-image
docker load < result
version=$(nix eval --raw .#version)
docker tag \
    ghcr.io/cardano-foundation/cardano-node-antithesis/asteria-game:$version \
    ghcr.io/cardano-foundation/cardano-node-antithesis/asteria-game:dev
```

`just load-docker-image` wraps the same steps.

## Run locally

```bash
INTERNAL_NETWORK=false docker compose \
    -f testnets/cardano_node_master/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

The compose file declares one `asteria-game` service. Its main process
is the indexer; the Antithesis composer invokes the baked-in scripts
inside that container during a test run.

For a local container smoke:

```bash
just logs asteria-game
docker compose -f testnets/cardano_node_master/docker-compose.yaml \
    exec asteria-game /bin/asteria-bootstrap
docker compose -f testnets/cardano_node_master/docker-compose.yaml \
    exec asteria-game /bin/asteria-game
```
