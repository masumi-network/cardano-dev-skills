# Freeze-and-Seize Substandard

A CIP-113 substandard for regulated stablecoins: denylist-aware transfer logic, seizure/freeze operations, and on-chain denylist management.

This substandard demonstrates how regulatory controls can be implemented on top of the CIP-113 core framework while preserving Cardano's native-token semantics.

## What it provides

- **Denylist** — On-chain sorted linked list of denied credentials (`blacklist_mint`, `blacklist_spend`)
- **Transfer validation** — Every transfer checks that sender and recipient are not denylisted (`example_transfer_logic`)
- **Constant-time checks** — O(1) verification via covering-node proofs against the sorted list
- **Issuer controls** — Authorised parties can freeze and seize tokens held by denylisted credentials

## Prerequisites

- [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions) v1.1.21 (pinned in `aiken.toml`)

## Build and test

```bash
aiken fmt --check
aiken check
aiken build
```

```

## How it fits CIP-113

This substandard is a **stake validator** invoked via a 0-ADA withdrawal, registered in the CIP-113 registry alongside the token's issuance policy. When a transfer occurs, the core `programmable_logic_global` validator looks the token up in the registry and requires this substandard's withdrawal to succeed — which is where denylist checks happen.
