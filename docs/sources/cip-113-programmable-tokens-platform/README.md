# CIP-113 Programmable Tokens — Platform

![CIP-113](https://img.shields.io/badge/CIP--113-Adapted-green)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-R&D-yellow)

**Off-chain platform, reference frontend, and substandard implementations for experimenting with CIP-113 programmable tokens on Cardano testnets.**

This repository is the **companion to the on-chain implementation**. The Aiken validators for the CIP-113 core framework live in a separate repository:

## Important Disclaimers

### Origins and Attribution

This work builds on the foundational **CIP-143 reference implementation** originally developed by Phil DiSarro and the IOG team ([input-output-hk/wsc-poc](https://github.com/input-output-hk/wsc-poc)). We are deeply grateful for the significant effort and expertise invested in the original design and implementation.

### CIP-113 Adaptation

This codebase has been adapted to align with **CIP-113**, which supersedes CIP-143 as a more comprehensive standard for programmable tokens on Cardano.

**Note:** CIP-113 is currently under active development ([PR #444](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444)) and has not been finalized. The specification may change as the standard evolves; this implementation reflects our current understanding and may require updates as CIP-113 matures.

## What's in this repository

This repository contains everything you need to exercise programmable tokens end-to-end on a Cardano testnet, except for the core on-chain validators (which live in the on-chain repository linked above).

### 1. Reference Frontend — `src/programmable-tokens-frontend/`

A Next.js web application for interacting with CIP-113 programmable tokens.

- Wallet connection (Nami, Eternl, Lace, Flint) via Mesh SDK
- Multi-network support (Preview, Preprod, Mainnet)
- Protocol deployment, token minting, transfers, blacklist management, and admin controls
- Tech stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Mesh SDK, Tailwind CSS, Blockfrost

📖 [Frontend README](./src/programmable-tokens-frontend/README.md)

### 2. Off-chain Backend — `src/programmable-tokens-offchain-java/`

A Spring Boot application providing transaction building and blockchain integration.

- Transaction construction for protocol operations
- Blockchain data access via Blockfrost / Yaci
- Integration tests for Preview testnet
- API endpoints for protocol interactions

📖 [Off-chain README](./src/programmable-tokens-offchain-java/README.md)

### 3. Substandards — `src/substandards/`

Substandards are the pluggable rule sets that define how specific programmable tokens behave on top of the CIP-113 core framework. Each substandard is its own Aiken project.

- **[`dummy/`](./src/substandards/dummy/)** — Minimal permissioned-transfer substandard requiring a specific credential; useful as a template and for integration tests.
- **[`freeze-and-seize/`](./src/substandards/freeze-and-seize/)** — Denylist-aware transfer logic, seizure/freeze operations, and on-chain denylist management for regulated stablecoins.

See each substandard's README for build and test instructions. For guidance on developing a new substandard, see the [on-chain repository's developer guide](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cip113-programmable-tokens-2/blob/main/documentation/09-DEVELOPING-SUBSTANDARDS.md).

## What Are Programmable Tokens?

Programmable tokens are **native Cardano assets** with an additional layer of validation logic that executes on every transfer, mint, or burn. They enable:

- **Regulatory compliance** — KYC/AML requirements, sanctions screening, transfer restrictions
- **Lifecycle controls** — Programmatic freeze, seize, and burn capabilities
- **Custom logic** — Pluggable validation scripts for denylists, allowlists, time-locks, and more
- **Native compatibility** — Built on Cardano's native token infrastructure with no hard fork required

### Use Cases

- Stablecoins with regulatory compliance
- Tokenized securities and real-world assets (RWAs)
- Regulated financial instruments
- Any token requiring programmable transfer rules

For a deeper walkthrough of the on-chain design, see the [on-chain repository's README](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cip113-programmable-tokens-2#readme) and [architecture doc](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cip113-programmable-tokens-2/blob/main/documentation/02-ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Project Status

**Current Status:** Research & Development

- ✅ Core on-chain validators implemented and tested (see the [on-chain repo](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cip113-programmable-tokens-2))
- ✅ Reference frontend with wallet integration and core flows
- ✅ Java off-chain service with transaction builders and Blockfrost/Yaci integration
- ✅ Dummy and Freeze-and-Seize substandards implemented
- ✅ Limited testing on Preview testnet
- ⏳ Comprehensive real-world testing required
- ⏳ **Professional security audit pending**

### Security Notice

⚠️ **This code has NOT been professionally audited and is NOT production-ready.** While code quality is high, do not use with real assets or in production environments without:

- Comprehensive security audit by qualified professionals
- Extensive testing across diverse scenarios
- Thorough review by domain experts

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Frontend:** Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended), npm or yarn, Blockfrost API key
- **Backend:** Java 17+, Gradle
- **Substandards:** [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions) v1.1.13+

### Frontend

```bash
cd src/programmable-tokens-frontend
npm install
cp .env.preview.example .env.preview   # add your Blockfrost key
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Off-chain backend

```bash
cd src/programmable-tokens-offchain-java
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
```

See the [backend README](./src/programmable-tokens-offchain-java/README.md) for PostgreSQL setup and configuration.

### Substandards

Each substandard is an independent Aiken project:

```bash
cd src/substandards/freeze-and-seize   # or src/substandards/dummy
aiken build
aiken check
```

For detailed setup, testing, and deployment instructions, see the respective README files in each subdirectory.
