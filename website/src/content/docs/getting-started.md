description: Install Cardano Dev Skills as a Claude Code plugin, a Codex skill set, or as a standalone Markdown reference.

Cardano Dev Skills works in three modes. Pick the one that matches your agent.

## Claude Code (recommended)

In any Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add easy1staking-com/cardano-dev-skills
/plugin install cardano-dev-skills@cardano-dev-skills
```

Installed once, active in every Claude Code session in any directory. Verify with:

```
/plugin list
```

## Install the per-project directive

Even with the plugin installed globally, Claude sometimes answers Cardano
questions from training data instead of consulting bundled skills and docs.
Run the `cardano-context` skill once per project to install a durable
directive:

```
/cardano-context
```

What it does:

- Writes a version-tagged block into the project's `CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code
  re-injects `CLAUDE.md` into every conversation turn, so the directive
  survives compaction and applies on every new session.
- Tells Claude to treat training data as potentially stale for Cardano, to
  bias toward invoking `cardano-dev-skills:*` skills, to search bundled
  `docs/sources/` before falling back on memory, and to cite what it used.
- Commit `CLAUDE.md` and teammates inherit the directive on clone.
- Re-running is safe: same version is a no-op; older versions are atomically
  replaced.

## Codex / other agents

```bash
git clone https://github.com/easy1staking-com/cardano-dev-skills.git
cd your-project
ln -s ../cardano-dev-skills/skills .agents/skills
```

## Standalone

Skills are pure Markdown — read `skills/*/SKILL.md` directly, or grep them.

## First prompt

Once installed, ask the agent something concrete that should match a skill:

> *"Scaffold a new Cardano project with Aiken on-chain and Mesh SDK off-chain."*

You should see the agent invoke the `scaffold-project` skill. If it doesn't,
nudge explicitly:

> *"Use the scaffold-project skill from cardano-dev-skills."*

See [How it works](/cardano-dev-skills/how-it-works/) for the three context
mechanisms and how to tell when one of them is doing the work.
